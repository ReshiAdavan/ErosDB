# ErosDB

My In-Memory Relational Database

## Inspiration

- I am looking to expand my knowledge in distributed systems, one project at a time. So far I covered Sentinel, a distributed KV storage which covered consensus algorithms, distributed networking, etc.
- I am looking to create a load balancer and database from scratch and maybe create a large-scale distributed system leveraging these components.

## Topics

- Languages: C
- Concepts
  - Techniques: Multi-threading
  - Data Structures/Algorithms: B-Trees, Recursion, Key \& Binary Search
  - Other: Persistence
